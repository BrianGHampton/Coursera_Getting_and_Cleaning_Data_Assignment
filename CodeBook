Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Week 4 Assignment

Code Book

The run_analysis.R script downloads the dataset and then completes the data preparation required in the assignment instructions:

1.	Download  and unzips the dataset and saves it into a folder called UCA HAR Dataset

2.	Assign the data to variables:
    •	features <- features.txt
    •	activities <- activity_labels.txt
    •	subject_test <- subject_test.txt
    •	x_test <- X_test.txt
    •	y_test <- Y_text.txt
    •	subject_train <- subject_train.txt
    •	x_train <- X_train.txt
    •	y_train <- Y_train.txt
    
3.	Merge the training and test data sets to create one data set:
    •	X merges the x_train and x_test using the rbind() function
    •	Y merges the y_train and y_test using the rbind() function
    •	Subject merges subject_train and subject_test using the rbind() function
    •	Merged_Data merges Subject, X, and Y using the cbind() function
    
4.	Extract only the mean and standard deviation for each measurement:
    •	TidyData subsets Merged_Data with only the subject and code columns and mean and standard deviation for each measurement
    
5.	Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set:
    •	The numbers in the ‘code’ column of TidyData are replaced with the corresponding activity in the second column of the activities variable
    
6.	Labels the data set with appropriately descriptive variable names:
    •	‘code’ column in TidyData renamed to ‘activity’
    •	Replace all column names containing ‘Acc’ with ‘Acceleration’
    •	Replace all column names containing ‘Gyro’ with ‘Gyroscope’
    •	Replace all column names containing ‘BodyBody’ with ‘Body’
    •	Replace all column names containing ‘Mag’ with ‘Magnitude’
    •	Replace all column names beginning with ‘t’ with ‘Time’
    •	Replace all column names beginning with’f’ with ‘Frequency’
    •	Replace all column names containing ‘angle’ with ‘Angular’
    
7.	From the TidyData created in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
    •	Exports TidyData into a file named TidyData.txt and saves it in the working directory
